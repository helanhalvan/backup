Reuirments:
Requires encore installed to work.
Visualization requires SDL2 to work. To disable visualization remove the import of SDL files from main. (line 4 in main.enc)

Build instructions:

Compile and run with:

./compile main.enc -r

Compile and make C code with:

./compile main.enc -c

If you want to do anything more fancy, use

encorec main.enc

with some options
